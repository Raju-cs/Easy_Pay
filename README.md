# Easy_pay

A new Flutter project.

# Introduction 
Reliability in public transport is of great importance today. We are proposing QR reader for bus bill. we are working it android system and using flutter framework dart language. In this app, after registration we have to attach online payment like Bikash or other bank transfer.  Whenever we go by bus, we have to select from and to location. Then it will generate amount details for per head. it Scan the QR code from the conductor of the bus with a particular ID. Then we

Can Scan QR code. So directly money will transfer from Bikash and other wallet to transport corporation on basis of conductor ID. Then we will get and SMS alert for Bill payment proof. The admin side (Transport Corporation), they calculate amount details of a particular conductor through using application. Then they can calculate per day amount details of Transport Corporation for buses.

# Idea and Concept in short 
1. Manage Apps what user want.
 2. Accessibility: 
               ▪ Only Admin access this app easily and modify it.
               ▪ Different transport companies to different users. 
               ▪ Registration users so they can only use the Apps they have access for.
 3. QR code generator
 4. Payment method
 5. User benefits (specially student benefits) 
 6. Location: select option or location details Info (help for passenger or user)
 7. Fare estimate list (location wise)
 8.Driver or conductor check amount option (Driver Panel)
 9.Chat with admin.
 10. Review option
# Scope and Objective
User:
⦁	Easily bill pay
⦁	View fare list
⦁	View destination
⦁	Edit his/her profile

Driver:
⦁	View bill payment details
Admin:
⦁	Update all information
⦁	add new bus
⦁	add destination
⦁	remove old bus

# Working Principles

# Admin
Admin can modify the application and also get all information of user. Admin also create user page and all user registration to user page as a subscriber. Different transport companies have different user admin also create different user page to easily find them.
Only registration user can use this app when they registration create different id. user cannot access admin panel. If admin give the chance to access admin panel then user can access it. But its not possible for any admin because it’s not secure.

# QR code generator
We are using QR code system for bill pay. Generate common QR code for customer easily payment their fare. But different transport companies have different user that’s why we generate different transport company different QR code.

# Payment method
In this app, after registration we have to attach online payment like Bikash or other bank transfer.  Whenever we go by bus, we have to select from and to location. Then it will generate amount of bill per head of customer.
When QR code scan automatically show option many payment methods like Bikash, Dutch Bangla, Rocket etc. 

# User benefits
This application mainly user benefits because user/passenger can easily make payment and also see the fare distribution or exactly fare rate. Other benefits for student holder when they are registration student should be must fill student option because their id is different and they also show their student id card to conductor.
 
# Fare estimate list (location wise)
we are also making a list fare estimate details feature where user/passenger can see the fare amount location wise. This is very helpful for user/ passenger because some time unethical situation happens, it’s also helpful for conductor or bus driver.
Driver or conductor check amount option
We are creating another panel called driver panel. Driver commonly used for when passenger directly money will transfer from Bikash and other wallet to transport corporation on basis of conductor ID. Then driver or conductor will get and SMS alert for Bill payment proof. And also see how much passenger pay their bill. Then they can calculate per day amount details.

# Chat option with admin
We also created a chat option where user connected with admin and share their problem with admin if any problem occurs.

 # Review or feedback option
 User can review their experience how the application working and which part should be making better.
 
 # The System Design
The system design phase describes the functional capabilities of the proposed system. Systems
design is the process of defining the architecture, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to
satisfy specified requirements. Systems design could be seen as the application of systems
theory to product development. This is divided into the following design phases:

Use case diagrams represent the functions of a system from the user’s point of view
